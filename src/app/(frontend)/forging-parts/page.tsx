        description="At TheSupplier.in, we leverage state-of-the-art technology and industry expertise to deliver best-in-class forging solutions. Our capabilities include:
Open-Die Forging: Utilizing flat dies without pre-cut profiles, we perform open-die forging to shape large parts weighing over 150 tons and up to 25 meters in length. This method allows for the creation of prototypes and low-volume production with excellent grain flow orientation and deformation characteristics.
Closed-Die Forging: Employing dies containing impressions of the desired shape, we achieve precise and complex geometries with closer tolerances. This process is suitable for a wide range of metals and alloys, including carbon and alloy steels, stainless steel, aluminum, and copper alloys.
Cold Forging: We offer cold forging processes such as bending, drawing, and extruding, ideal for creating shapes with superior dimensional control and surface finish. Cold forging is particularly effective for parts weighing up to 5 kg and offers advantages in product uniformity and contamination control.
Rolled Ring Forging: Our expertise extends to rolled ring forging, where thick metal pieces are punched to create donut shapes and then rolled or pounded into thin rings. This process is suitable for various applications across industries."
